 NOTES ON HTTP TIMEOUT

  Vantiv eCommerce optimizes our systems to ensure the return of responses as quickly as possible, some portions of the process are beyond our control.
  The round-trip time of an Authorization can be broken down into three parts, as follows:
    1.  Transmission time (across the internet) to Vantiv eCommerce and back to the merchant
    2.  Processing time by the authorization provider
    3.  Processing time by Cnp 
  Under normal operating circumstances, the transmission time to and from Cnp does not exceed 0.6 seconds 
  and processing overhead by Cnp occurs in 0.1 seconds. 
  Typically, the processing time by the card association or authorization provider can take between 0.5 and 3 seconds,
  but some percentage of transactions may take significantly longer.
 
  Because the total processing time can vary due to a number of factors, Vantiv eCommerce recommends using a minimum timeout setting of
  60 seconds to accomodate Sale transactions and 30 seconds if you are not utilizing Sale tranactions.

  These settings should ensure that you do not frequently disconnect prior to receiving a valid authorization causing dropped orders 
  and/or re-auths and duplicate auths.
