Vantiv eCommerce Ruby SDK 
=====================
#### Warning:
#### All version changes require recertification to the new version. Once certified for the use of a new version, Vantiv modifies your Merchant Profile, allowing you to submit transaction to the Production Environment using the new version. Updating your code without recertification and modification of your Merchant Profile will result in transaction declines. Please consult you Implementation Analyst for additional information about this process.

Setup
-----

1) Install the LitleOnline Ruby gem from rubygems.org, this will install the latest SDK gem in your Ruby environment.
Our gem is available publicly from rubygems.org.  Use the command below to install.

>sudo gem install LitleOnline

Note: If you get errors, you might have to configure your proxy.

2) Once the gem is installed run our setup program to generate a configuration file.  The configuration file resides in your home directory
$HOME/.cnp_SDK_config.yml

For more details on setup see our instructions [here](https://github.com/Vantiv/cnp-sdk-for-ruby/blob/master/SETUP.md)

3.) Create a ruby file similar to:  

```ruby
require 'CnpOnline'
include CnpOnline

# Visa $10 Sale
cnpSaleTxn = {
    'reportGroup'=>'rpt_grp',
    'orderId'=>'1234567',
    'card'=>{
        'type'=>'VI',
        'number' =>'4100000000000001',
        'expDate' =>'1212'},
        'orderSource'=>'ecommerce',
        'amount'=>'1000'
    }

# Peform the transaction on the Cnp Platform
response = CnpOnlineRequest.new.sale(cnpSaleTxn)

# display result
puts "Message: "+ response.message
puts "Cnp Transaction ID: "+ response.saleResponse.cnpTxnId
```

3) Next run this file using ruby. You should see the following result provided you have connectivity to the Cnp certification environment.  You will see an HTTP error if you don't have access to the Cnp URL

    Message: Valid Format
    Cnp Transaction ID: <your-numeric-cnp-txn-id>
